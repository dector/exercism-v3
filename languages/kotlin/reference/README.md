## Concepts

Kotlin concept exercises are based on concepts. They are (mostly) connected with the corresponding parts of [official Kotlin reference](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-syntax.html#defining-packages).

## Concept interpretation

```diff
! WIP
```

The concept exercises use the following concepts:

| concept | interpretation |
|
| --- | --- |

## Reference docs

```diff
! WIP
```

Reference docs are written to help explain a particular Kotlin concept to a student as an addition to other docs available onlin. They will be used when creating exercises and as references in exercise documentation.
